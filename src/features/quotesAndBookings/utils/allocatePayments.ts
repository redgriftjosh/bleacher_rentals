/**
 * Works out how much of an event's money has actually arrived, and where it sits.
 *
 * `PaymentHistory` is the source of truth: it holds the amounts that really
 * moved. An installment carries no payment state of its own — it used to cache
 * one, and reading that flag to decide how much was paid is what let a $1.00
 * payment close a $3,600.00 installment in production. The columns are gone;
 * every screen asks this function instead, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * Amounts are signed. A refund, a bounced check and a corrected typo are all
 * negative rows, because the ledger is append-only and an offsetting row is the
 * only way to undo anything. So this walks in both directions: money fills
 * installments oldest-first, and a net loss un-fills them newest-first, on the
 * reading that a refund reopens the most recent obligation. Nothing is clamped
 * out of existence on the way — `totalReceivedCents` is every counted cent of
 * either sign, and it may legitimately be negative.
 *
 * Placement is computed from aggregates rather than by walking payments in
 * order, which is what makes a refund and the payment it reverses commute.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: no clock, no I/O, no mutation of the caller's arrays.
 * See docs/specs/payment-accounting-truth.md and
 * docs/specs/manual-payment-entry.md §3.3–§3.4.
