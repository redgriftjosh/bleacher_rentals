/**
 * Records money that never touched Stripe: a check, an ACH transfer, a card
 * run by hand on a terminal.
 *
 * Local-first, and that matters more here than usual. The row goes into the
 * PowerSync DB and appears in the history table immediately; the upload
 * connector replays it to PostgREST under the user's Clerk JWT, where the RLS
 * INSERT policy — not this function — decides whether it is allowed.
 *
 * **The upload's verdict never comes back.** `typedExecute` resolves once the
 * row is in the local database. If PostgREST later refuses it, the connector
 * treats the code as fatal and discards the transaction with a console error
 * (BackendConnector.ts:110). So a resolved promise here means "written
 * locally", not "accepted" — which is why the guards below run before the
 * write rather than trusting the CHECK constraints to catch a bad row. A
 * constraint violation is code 23514, and that is in the fatal set too: it
 * would take the payment down silently.
 *
 * Amounts are signed. A negative row is a refund, a bounced check or the
 * correction of a typo, and it is the only way to undo anything in an
 * append-only ledger.
 *
 * See docs/specs/manual-payment-entry.md §3.1, §4.3, §5, T0, T4.
