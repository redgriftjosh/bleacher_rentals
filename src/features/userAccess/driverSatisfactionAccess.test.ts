/**
 * Who may open /driver-satisfaction.
 *
 * The page shows every driver's named, non-anonymous opinion of the app and of
 * their work. Two things therefore have to stay true, and neither is visible
 * from the page's own code:
 *
 *  * all four office roles can reach it — the sync rules give each of them its
 *    own copy of the three tables, and a role allowed to sync the data but not
 *    to open the page would be a silent dead end;
 *  * a driver cannot reach it at all. A driver reading the fleet's scores is
 *    the one disclosure this feature must not make, and `mergeRoleConfigs`
 *    UNIONS the paths of every role a user holds — so this also pins down the
 *    driver-who-is-also-something-else case, where a union could quietly hand a
 *    driver a page the driver half was never meant to see.
