-- ============================================================================
-- Tests for "Fixed by driver" on DamageReports
-- Migration: 20260909120000_damage_reports_fixed_by_driver.sql
-- Spec: br_driver/docs/specs/driver-fixed-damage-reports.md
--
-- Run via docker:
--   docker exec -i $(docker ps --filter "name=supabase_db" --format "{{.ID}}" | head -1) \
--     psql -U postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < supabase/tests/damage_reports_fixed_by_driver.test.sql
--
-- What is under test:
--   1. the three columns exist, with the defaults the app relies on;
--   2. the CHECK constraint makes a half-filled "fixed" state unwritable;
--   3. a driver may mark ANOTHER driver's report fixed (the product decision:
--      whoever was on site fixed it, not whoever filed the report);
--   4. that same driver may change NOTHING ELSE on the report — the write is
--      deliberately cross-driver, so its blast radius is fenced server-side
--      rather than by the client being polite;
--   5. and that the fence does not catch the database's OWN writes: the photo
--      queue's status update cascades into `photos_uploaded` under the same
--      driver JWT, and rejecting it stalls that driver's whole upload queue.
