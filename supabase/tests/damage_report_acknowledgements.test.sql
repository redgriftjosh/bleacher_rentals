-- Tests for DamageReportAcknowledgements ("select all that apply")
-- Migration: 20260909140000_damage_report_acknowledgements.sql
-- Spec: br_driver/docs/specs/damage-report-dedupe.md
--
-- Run via docker:
--   docker exec -i $(docker ps --filter "name=supabase_db" --format "{{.ID}}" | head -1) \
--     psql -U postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < supabase/tests/damage_report_acknowledgements.test.sql
--
-- An acknowledgement is what a driver writes INSTEAD of a duplicate damage
-- report: "I see this one too". Three things make it worth a test file of its
-- own rather than a column somewhere:
--
--   1. `report_resolved_at` mirrors the parent's `resolved_at` onto every ack,
--      because the mobile sync rule filters on it. A JOIN there compiles into a
--      parameter query capped at 1000 rows, which is exactly how first sync
--      broke once already (PSYNC_S2305) — so the mirror is load-bearing, and
--      these tests are what say it stays maintained in both directions.
--   2. A duplicate ack must be a NO-OP, never an error. PowerSync retries a
--      rejected write forever without moving past it, so a 23505 on one ack
--      would stall the driver's entire upload queue.
--   3. An ack is a record, not a document: a driver files their own and can
--      neither rewrite nor withdraw it.
