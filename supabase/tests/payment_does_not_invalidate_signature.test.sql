-- ============================================================================
-- Paying an installment must not invalidate the contract signature.
--
-- A client who paid was being asked to re-sign a contract nobody had changed:
-- the webhook wrote PaymentInstallments.status, that column sat inside the
-- canonical document behind contract_hash, the hash moved, and the invalidation
-- trigger fired. Payment state is a cache of allocatePayments, never a term of
-- the agreement, so it has no business in either hash.
--
-- See docs/specs/payment-does-not-invalidate-signature.md §5, §9.
--
-- Verifies:
--   * T1 — recording a payment leaves contract_hash byte-identical and the
--          signature active
--   * T2 — it leaves content_hash byte-identical too (no "quote updated" modal
--          on the payer's own screen)
--   * T3 — the terms that ARE contract-material still invalidate: installment
--          amount, installment due date, adding one, removing one
--   * T4 — the re-anchoring invariant holds across the whole database: no
--          active signature disagrees with its event's current contract_hash
